            I am currently an upper sophmore attending BMCC, studying computer
            science! Below you will find a couple of cool facts about myself.

            <li>The fastest I have ever solved a Rubiks Cube is 14 seconds.</li>
            <li>I will be flying to Peru before the summer.</li>
            <li>I don't listen to any music.</li>

                When I was in middle school I was the class president. I'm not
                sure why all I did was tell jokes at my podium speech.
            </li>
            <li>
                I am very easy going, I am not very picky when it comes to food
                or places to hang out.
